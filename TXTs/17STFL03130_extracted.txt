NOTICE
Flissolution or legal separation may automatically cancel the rights of a spouse or domestic partner under the other spouse's or
domestic partner's will, trust, retirement plan, power of attorney, pay-on-death bank account, transfer-on-death vehicle registration,
survivorship rights to any property owned in joint tenancy, and any other similar property interest. It does not automatically cancel the
ights of a spouse or domestic partner as beneficiary of the other spouse's or domestic partner's life insurance policy. You should
ceview these matters, as well as any credit cards, other credit accounts, insurance policies, retirement plans, and credit reports, to
getermine whether they should be changed or whether you should take any other actions.
A debt or obligation may be assigned to one party as part of the dissolution of property and debts, but if that party does not pay the
debt or obligation, the creditor may be able to collect from the other party.
An earnings assignment may be issued without additional proof if child, family, partner, or spousal support is ordered.
Any party required to pay support must pay interest on overdue amounts at the "legal rate," which is currently 10 percent.

The guideline amount should be rebutted because of the following:

$
per month; the agreement is in the best interest of the children; the needs of the children
will be met adequately by the agreed amount; the children are not receiving public assistance; no application
for public assistance is pending: and application of the guideline would be unjust and inappropriate in this case.
We understand thati if the order is below the guideline, no change of circumstances need be shown for the court
to raise this order to the guideline amount. If the order is above the guideline, a change of circumstances will be
required to modify this order.
